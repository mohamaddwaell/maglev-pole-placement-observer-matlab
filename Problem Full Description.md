The goal of this report is to investigate the effect of the noise of the system states on the performance of the system 
when a pole placement via state feedback is implemented. It, also, aims to study the effect of the noise of the 
system output and states on both the state observer and the system performances. 
The system under investigation is the Magnetic Levitation system
In this report, we will use the magnetically suspended ball as an 
example. This is an example for a magnetic levitation system. It has 
practical application in high speed trains.
Consider the schematic diagram shown in the next figure. The 
current through the coil induces a magnetic force which can 
balance the force of gravity and cause the ball (which is made of a
magnetic material) to be suspended in midair. 
Let h be the vertical position of the ball, i be the current through 
the electromagnet, V be the applied voltage (control signal), M be
the mass of the ball, g be gravity, L be the inductance, R be the 
resistance, and K be a coefficient that determines the magnetic 
force exerted on the ball. For simplicity, we will choose values M = 0.05 Kg, K = 0.0001, L = 0.01 H, R = 1 Ohm, g = 9.81 
m/sec2
. The system is at equilibrium (the ball is suspended in midair) whenever h = K * i^2/Mg (at which point dh/dt = 0). 
We linearize the equations about the point h = 0.01 m (where the nominal current is about 7 Amps.) and get the state 
space equations.

Requirements:
Deduce the nonlinear state space model of the system. Then, linearize the model using Taylor Series Expansion 
around its equilibrium point. Show that the resulting matrices are as given.
Discretize the linear continuous state space model using three different values of the sampling period. 
For each of the above discrete systems, draw 𝑥(kT) versus k. The input is assumed to be step with suitable value. 
Compare these results to the result of the linear continous system. Comment on your results.
For the discrete systems, choose appropriate pole locations and find the corresponding suitable state feedback
gains.
Apply each discrete feedback gain to the continuous system and find the continuous system step response. 
Comment on your results.
Study the effect of noisy states and/or output on the responses of the above systems. 
For each of the discrete systems design a full-order observer and check the performance of each system in the 
existence of the state feedback and the observer.
Apply each discrete observer with its corresponding feedback gain to the continuous system and find the continuous 
system step response. Comment on your results.
Study the effect of noisy states and/or output on the responses of the above systems
